# Find Breweries
This project is a React/Typescript based that play with [OpenBreweriesDB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation) data. 
Users can see list of breweries and also search by name, also pagination and sort with the api.

## What I have done...
1. Fetch and get the data from [OpenBreweriesDB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation) 
2. Use react-router-dom
3. React-hook-form validation / lodash for optimization (debounce) 
4. MaterialUI
5. Deployment to Netlify
